# Most common errors using Kong (WIP)

## Free Kong with Hybrid Kong Mode.

A very common error happens when installing kong where the decision tree gives us some options when starting the installation process.

When `vkpr kong install` is started, if we select the `hybrid` option when asked about `Kong Mode:` we will need to enter the path of a valid Kong enterprise license, because if Kong is installed without a valid license, the installation process will time out and stop.

```sh
$ vkpr kong install
? Type the Kong domain: localhost
? Secure ? false
? Kong Mode: (Hybrid only available in Kong Enterprise) hybrid
? Select the plane to install control
? Type the full path to the license: null
? Type the RBAC Admin Password. Has no effect on hybrid data plane installations: vkpr123
? HA ? false
? Dry-run ? false

Release "kong" does not exist. Installing it now.
Error: release kong failed, and has been uninstalled due to atomic being set: timed out waiting for the condition
```

### Solving

Enter a valid enterprise license or select `dbless` or `standard` when asked about `Kong Mode`.
